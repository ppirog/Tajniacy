My implementation of Tajniacy. 

Tajniacy Game is my favourite board game.
Unfortunately this game consist of many elements and takes up a lot of space in backpack, which is not conveniant in use for example in trip or party.
That's the reason why I created this game. Laptop is much more handy and nowadays everyone has is all the time.
I wanted to create implementation which enables to play using ONLY ONE COMPUTER WITHOUT INTERNET!
